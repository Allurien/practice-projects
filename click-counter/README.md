# Click Counter

- Create code that counts the number of times the div is clicked
it finishes counting if you don't click for 2 seconds

- For example, if I click 5 times rapidly, and then don't click
for 2 seconds, it will show 5.

- If I click 2 times, wait 1.9 seconds, and click a third time, 
2 seconds after the third click, it will show 3
